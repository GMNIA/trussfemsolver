# trussfemsolver
Small repo to test custom implementation of truss beam solver in cpp environment.

As a python developer, the idea of the project is:
- to test cpp in a numerical environment while learning in a field (fem analysis) where I have a strong background
- quality of cpp code is there only in same part of the code significant
- using a professional testing suite
- compare workflow + code quality (and possibly) efficiency of python cpp libraries with cpp code directly for this small use case
